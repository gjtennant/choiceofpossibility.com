			<h2>Body Processes</h2>

			<p>What if you could hear the whispers of your body? What gift would your beautiful body have for you? Is now the time to receive it?</p>

			<p>Our bodies are amazing sensory organisms. They are designed to give you the awareness of everything and everyone around you. So much effort has been given to taking us away from our own knowing. We are trained to believe what the doctor, teacher, parent, newscaster tells us, and to disregard our own knowing. What change could you create in your life if you allow the only one who truly knows what is true for you to have a voice?</p>

			<p>The Access Consciousness body processes are created to undo all the unconsciousness we hold in our body that keeps us locked in repeating patterns that don't work for us.</p>

			<h4>I invite you to ask your body</h4>

			<p>Together we will follow the energy of the body &ndash; trusting its wisdom.   During each session, the body will take us on a journey of unlocking the You that only you can be.  Along with the hands-on body processes &ndash; I have over 40 processes that the body can choose from &ndash; I will run clearing statements and ask questions that will allow you to create the life and the body that You choose.</p>

			<p>How does it get better than that?</p>

			<p>What change have you been asking for?</p>

				<h5>Access Consciousness body processes followed by short Bars: $100 / Between 1 and 1.5 hours
				</h5>

				<p>Access Consciousness has over 40 processes that the body can choose from to either address a specific condition or allow the body to choose freely.Â  The time will be divided between the chosen body process and a shortened Bars session. </p>

				<h5>Bars: $100 / Between 1 and 1.5 hours
	<!--				<br>
	 				<small>
						3 week commitment: $75/session
					</small>
	 -->			</h5>
				
				<p>My standard fee for all my services is the same: $100 for the first hour, and then it's $1 per minute for any additional time. For example, 1.5 hours is $130, and 2 hours is $160.</p>

				<p>However, I truly wish to expose Bars and Access Body Processes to as many people as I can, so I charge a flat fee of $100 for a session that lasts between 1 hour and 1.5 hours. </p>

				<p>Sessions that include a lot of verbal processing tend to go longer, and I invite you, <strong>but do not require you</strong>, to pay my standard fee.</p>

				<p>If you would like to have a weekly session or even a bi-weekly session, and the per-session cost makes it difficult, I'm willing to explore the possibilities. I know that money follows joy, and having a sense of space and possibility creates joy, which is precisely what The Bars offers! The more joy you create, the more money you will have and the more you can pay for a session! Let's build to that. How does it get even better?</p>
