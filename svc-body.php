			<h2>Body Processes</h2>

			<p>What if you could hear the whispers of your body? What gift would your beautiful body have for you? Is now the time to receive it?</p>

			<p>Our bodies are amazing sensory organisms. They are designed to give you the awareness of everything and everyone around you. So much effort has been given to taking us away from our own knowing. We are trained to believe what the doctor, teacher, parent, newscaster tells us, and to disregard our own knowing. What change could you create in your life if you allow the only one who truly knows what is true for you to have a voice?</p>

			<p>The Access Consciousness body processes are created to undo all the unconsciousness we hold in our body that keeps us locked in repeating patterns that don't work for us.</p>

			<h4>I invite you to ask your body</h4>

			<p>Together we will follow the energy of the body &ndash; trusting its wisdom.   During each session, the body will take us on a journey of unlocking the You that only you can be.  Along with the hands-on body processes &ndash; I have over 40 processes that the body can choose from &ndash; I will run clearing statements and ask questions that will allow you to create the life and the body that You choose.</p>

			<p>How does it get better than that?</p>

			<p>What change have you been asking for?</p>

				<h5>Access Consciousness body processes followed by short Bars: $100 / Between 1 and 1.5 hours

				<p>Access Consciousness has over 40 processes that the body can choose from to either address a specific condition or allow the body to choose freely.Â  The time will be divided between the chosen body process and a shortened Bars session. </p>

				<h5>Bars: $100 / Between 1 and 1.5 hours

						3 week commitment: $75/session

				<p>Would you be willing to be the creator of your own life from a place of infinite possibilities? The Bars can assist. It may take more than one session to open you up. Many people cannot sense an immediate change, but if they are willing, their life will change. Would you like to have more joy in your life? Agreeing to a weekly Bars session can create that, and I would like to make that possible for as many people as I can. My weekly rate is $75 a session.</p>

				<p>If you would like to have a weekly session, and the per-session cost makes it difficult, I'm willing to explore the possbilities. I know that money follows joy, so the more joy you create, the more money you will have and the more you can pay for a session! Let's build to that! How does it get even better?</p>
