			<p>There are 32 points on your head which, when gently touched, effortlessly and easily release anything that you have made unchangeable.  These points contain all the points of view, thoughts, ideas, beliefs, emotions, and considerations you have stored in any lifetime.</p>

			<p>By simply relaxing as I sequentially touch the 32 points, your whole life could change, or at worst you will feel like you just had the best massage of your life.</p>

			<p>This is an incredibly nurturing and relaxing process, undoing limitation in all aspects of your life.  What will you choose?</p>

			<blockquote>
				The brain waves slow down when you get your Bars run, allowing behavioral patterns, belief systems and points of view that you've been running from childhood or from other lifetimes to be accessed.

			</blockquote>

			<p>The Bars has assisted thousands of people to change many aspects of their body and their life including sleep, health and weight, money, sex and relationships, anxiety, stress, depression and so much more!

			<p>The Bars and all of the Access Consciousness body processes are especially nice when going through transitions.  In order to experience the most ease with change, it is recommended to have a Bars session weekly for 4 weeks initially, and then spread them out over a couple of weeks, or monthly.  There is no right or wrong way for how often; it is totally up to you.</p>

			<p>The Bars can be completed in silence.  What if all your "problems" just disappear without one discussion about them?  That is totally possible!  The efficiency of the release can be increased though by adding verbal processing.  When you ask a question, I will utilize the Access Consciousness clearing statement.  The clearing statement is short-speak for all the places you are holding any point of view in polarity.  It wipes out all the tethers, and allows you to move back into choice. I invite you to visit the Access page dedicated to explaining it: <a href='http://www.theclearingstatement.com' target='_blank'>www.theclearingstatement.com</a></p>

			<p>You could also combine a Bars session with a Beach Walk.  See the <a href="./svc-beach.php">Beach Sessions</a> page for specifics.</p>

			<h4>Are you pregnant?</h4>

			<p>One Bars session has been known to reduce labor time!  How does it get even better?  Agree to a weekly session within a four week period and receive my special “Congratulations, you're pregnant!” rate of $60 per session.</p>

			<h4>The Bars<sup>&reg</sup> and Children</h4>

			<p>Children of all ages also benefit greatly from Bars.  A Bars session creates space, which makes test taking or social events usually transpire with more ease. Has your child been diagnosed with autism, ADD or something similar?  Weekly Bars could be the ease you are looking for.  Come and explore.</p>

			<p>Children's sessions are also usually a lot quicker than adults', even as short as 15 minutes for those under 12 years.  Rates will be adjusted accordingly.</p>

			<h4>Experience a Bars Session and Receive You!</h4>

			<blockquote>"I was so relaxed after our session. It has been a long time since I have had that much peace in myself."</blockquote>

			<blockquote>"I was more in my power.  I did not have a need to engage in things that really did not involve me."</blockquote>

			<blockquote>"My neck loosened up, and my lower back area clicked into place, as it were, much like a cranial-sacral result.  Very interesting!"</blockquote>

			<blockquote>"Renee Tennant's work is powerful, and created a healing space for chronic back and leg pain to feel much relief in less than one hour!  As a 27-year registered nurse who studies quantum integral medicine, and utilizes pilates and emotional freedom technique for healing, I thank Renee to no end for her talent and commitment in sharing the Bars technique.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!"</blockquote>

			<p>Here is an excerpt from a radio interview with a chiropractor whose wife, diagnosed with bipolar disorder, had committed suicide, leaving him to raise his three kids alone.  He was asked what tools from Access Consciousness he used with them:</p>

			<article class='longquote'>
				<p>To be honest with you, I personally could not tell a difference with my first Bars session, but I watched a huge impact it had on the boys.</p>

				<p>My one son, who is very hyper and who could easily be diagnosed with at least hyperactivity disorder for sure, it (the Bars) literally knocked him out &ndash; within fifteen, twenty minutes he was snoring, sleeping.  And it happens virtually every time.  If he doesn't fall asleep, it looks like someone has given him a tranquilizer.  And the other son just fell asleep within 60 seconds.</p>

				<p>I knew by watching and observing the boys that there was something that was very strong and powerful about the Bars, and then after about my fifth session I realized that wow, I could literally feel a physiological difference.  And I swear I could almost feel lifetimes of stuff leaving my body.  And the awareness and the joy that filled my body the very next day &ndash; it was only about 11 months after my wife had passed away, and I almost started to feel guilty for even having that much joy in my reality, because I had the point of view that you are not supposed to have any joy if someone that you love has only been dead 11 months.</p>

				<p>So that was the number one tool, the Bars.</p> 

				<p>And as time went on, helping the boys and my daughter understand that 98% of their thoughts are not even theirs.  So when they start complaining about how they're feeling, I will ask them immediately who does that belong to?  Is it yours?  Is it someone else's?  Is it something else's?  And a lot of the time they'll say, "It's yours, Dad."  So how much of my stuff are they picking up on?</p>

				<p>And I'll never forget, one time my middle son was having a panic attack.  He had just finished first place at his karate tournament and it was his birthday, and I promised to take him out on a one-on-one date.  We went bowling together, and I noticed he was starting to hyperventilate.  I asked him what was the matter, and he said, "I don't know.  I just feel like I can't breathe."  So to make a long story short, I said, "Let's go home and I'll run your Bars," and of course he resisted and reacted to it initially because he just wanted to watch the football game and have some fun.  But I said, "Son, please lay down."  And he laid down and I swear by the time we got to the part of the head that deals with peace, kindness and gratitude, he was literally sleeping.  And I ran his Bars for three days in a row and those big deep breaths that he was always gasping for were gone.</p> 

				<p>So I would say that the most profound thing that I implemented right away was the Bars.</p>

				<h5>Bars: $100 / Between 1 and 1.5 hours
<!--					<br>
 					<small>
						3 week commitment: $75/session
					</small>
 -->				</h5>
				
				<p>My standard fee for all my services is the same: $100 for the first hour, and then it's $1 per minute for any additional time. For example, 1.5 hours is $130, and 2 hours is $160.</p>

				<p>However, I truly wish to expose Bars and Access Body Processes to as many people as I can, so I charge a flat fee of $100 for a session that lasts between 1 hour and 1.5 hours. </p>

				<p>Sessions that include a lot of verbal processing tend to go longer, and I invite you, <strong>but do not require you</strong>, to pay my standard fee.</p>

				<p>If you would like to have a weekly session or even a bi-weekly session, and the per-session cost makes it difficult, I'm willing to explore the possibilities. I know that money follows joy, and having a sense of space and possibility creates joy, which is precisely what The Bars offers! The more joy you create, the more money you will have and the more you can pay for a session! Let's build to that. How does it get even better?</p>
