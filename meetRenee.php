			<h2>About Renee</h2>

			<p>Renee is a certified Access Bars<sup>&reg</sup> Facilitator and certified Bioenergy Balancing Practitioner.  She has been an intuitive facilitator since 2009, and an energetic Being forever!</p>

			<p>Her goal in any given session is to create space for choice.  From that space of infinite choice, anything is possible.  Her knowledge of how the physical body typically works, and how creative we are in energetically tying ourselves up, enables her to ask questions and perceive connections that are not often obvious.  She is playful in her approach, and creates an environment of nonjudgement that allows the body and the Being to choose differently.</p> 

			<h3>What are you willing to choose?</h3>

			<p>Even though Renee can give a very accurate read on your immediate energy and what is potential in this given moment, she cannot predict the future.  You as the infinite Being always have infinite choice, and even if you have the potential of any prediction, if you don't choose it from all the infinite possibilities, the read won't come to pass.</p>

			<p>Instead of giving you future guesses, her intention is to ask questions and allow you to have the awareness of what you are choosing now, and what you are willing to choose.</p>

			<h3>Certified Practitioner</h3>

			<p>As a certified Bioenergy Balancing Practitioner and a certified Access Consciousness Bars<sup>&reg</sup> Facilitator and a scholar of Holographic Programs, Renee skillfully assists you in discovering and altering limiting beliefs and traumas.  Her training as a Bioenergy Balancing practitioner taught her how to communicate with the body and translate the language of the body &ndash; its biochemistry.</p>

			<p>The body's job is to support you and all your points of view.  It is completely devoted to making you right!  By understanding how the body functions &ndash; for example what biochemical cascade is used in the creation of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with depression &ndash; she is able to fine-tune the questions and have an in-depth conversation with the body as to what points of view is it expressing with the physical symptoms being experienced.</p>

			<p>Renee comfortably addresses biochemical principles of the body with the assurance that the changes the body made and the points of view you've taken in moments of stress are reversible &ndash; allowing allergies and long-standing conditions to be eliminated.</p>

			<p>The dialogue is usually fascinating as the body takes you to exact moments when you've reduced your infinite Being into a fixed position.  It is often an exploration of fitting in or a survival tactic to make it through an oppressive situation.  You are incredibly creative and adaptable!</p>

			<blockquote>“Renee is an amazing, wonderful, passionate healer who is very astute and has a gift with feeling and intuition. I can't describe how life changing and incredibly grateful I am to have the opportunity to work weekly with Renee. She has brought clarity, better well being, and calmness to my life!”</blockquote>

			<h3>Distance is not a factor</h3>

			<p>Whether working on the phone or in person, Renee will connect energetically with your energy body.  She'll receive yes or no answers by reading the expansion and contraction of your field with muscle testing. She'll engage with your highest self and spiritual guides and receive answers intuitively. These answers come from beyond your mind and the ego, and are in alignment with your true self, your higher self.</p>

			<p>If you were able to figure out your situation with your mind, you would have already done it.  Renee creates a relationship with your energy and through that confidence and your conscious willingness, your own true knowing will lead us to those decisions and points of view that are holding your reality in its current state. With that awareness and consciousness, you are able to choose your life.</p>

			<p>Your physical and energetic body knows precisely what is needed and will lead us in facilitating a shift. You are the expert!</p>

			<p>Renee is also well versed in Hoʻoponopono, Emotion Code, Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), Holographic patterning, the Release Technique<sup>&reg</sup>, and PSYCH-K<sup>&reg</sup>.
