			<h1>Renee Tennant</h1>
			<h2>Certified Intuitive Facilitater</h2>

			<p>Are your health or your relationships with people and events not what you want?</p>  

			<p>Do you have an injury, long-standing allergy or physical condition that is not responding to traditional methods?</p>
			
			<p>Do you feel like you don't know how to create a reality of your choosing?</p>

			<p>Rest assured, on some level you do know. In fact, you are the only one who does. However, as often is the case, we are so programmed by the reality around us that it is hard to perceive what we know.</p>

			<p>By combining principles of Bioenergy Balancing and Access Consciousness, Renee, an intuitive facilitator, invites you to those points of view you locked down in the past which have created your current state.</p>

			<p>She connects with you energetically and assists you in translating your true knowing.</p>

			<h3>Bioenergy Balancing</h3>

			<p>Bioenergy Balancing is a healing modality developed by Priscilla Kapel in Palo Alto. It combines accurate muscle reading with precise questioning based on the biochemistry of the body.  For example, by knowing that depression is often connected to low serotonin, and that serotonin is part of the tryptophan biochemical cascade, the questioning of the body using muscle testing can pinpoint exactly when the cascade was interrupted and serotonin was thrown off.</p>

			<p>Often the source of the decision is emotional – such as a disconnect from milk and caregiver – or an exposure to an outside stimulus – such as a pesticide or physical trauma.</p>

			<h3>Access Consciousness Bars<sup>&reg</sup></h3>

			<p>The Bars<sup>&reg</sup> is a hands-on energetic process and the first step in Access Consciousness. Access Consciousness is a set of pragmatic tools and techniques designed to assist you in changing anything in your life that isn't working. Like you, it is constantly evolving.</p>

			<p>Some of Access' basic principles:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Your point of view creates your reality, not the other way around</li>
				<li>The majority of what you think and feel is you picking up on other people's thoughts, feelings and emotions</li>
				<li>Judgement is merely an interesting point of view</li>
				<li><em>Consciousness is judging nothing and allowing everything</li>
				<li>Allowing is knowing that everything is just an interesting point of view</em></li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Benefits of combining Bioenergy Balancing and Access Consciousness principles:</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Accessing and changing injuries or allergies that are not responding
				</li>
				<li>
					Finding space and other possibilities when interacting with others' choices
				</li>
				<li>
					Seeing something from a different perspective which allows you to choose something that works better for you
				</li>
			</ul>
