			<h3>How long have you been doing the same things over and over again while hoping for change? Would you like to stop the insanity, and create something different?</h3>

			<hr>

			<p style="text-align:center;">Access Consciousness offers a dynamic set of tools and processes that give you the power to unlock things most people have been unable to resolve for years. For anything to limit you, some form of unconsciousness must be blocking your knowing. This is your invitation to wake up from the autopilot patterns you have been functioning from, and discover just how turned on and alive YOU can BE!</p>

			<hr>

			<h4><strong>Foundation</strong> | April 2nd &amp; 3rd | $700 ($350 if repeating within 12 months) | Prerequisite: Access Bars</h4>

			<p>If attending an Access Bars class left you wanting more expansion into the space of greater choice and infinite possibilities, then Foundation class is where the magic happens next! In this class, you will discover how decisions, judgments, conclusions, reasons, justifications and beliefs create what's keeping you stuck, and receive tools and processes to use in your daily life that empower you to change anything that is not working for you. Learn to function from your own knowing, so you can have greater trust in YOU! If you could change anything in your life, what would it be?</p>

			<h4><strong>Level 1</strong> | April 4th &amp; 5th | $700 ($350 if repeating within 12 months) | Prerequisite: Bars &amp; Foundation</h4>

			<p>The Level 1 class takes you further into living from non-judgment, so you can reclaim more of your awareness as an infinite being. We continue to unlock where you're functioning from defense, opposition and separation, which opens the door to infinite choice and possibility. Advance further with more tools and processes that allow you to have greater ease with money, sex, relationship, your body and more. Are you ready to thrive beyond the limited parameters of this reality?</p>

			<p>Tamara Younker has been researching the energetics of relating for 13 years. She has an expertise in guiding clients to cultivate and function from a powerful and aware presence that allows them to live more creatively in the world and less at the effect of it. She facilitates Access Consciousness Core Classes internationally, as well as, her own specialty classes on Intimacy. It's Tamara's desire to contribute to the emergence of a new paradigm for interpersonal relating, one that arises from allowance and choice rather than judgment and control. Her joy is inviting others to give up their current dependence on judgment as a valuable strategy for separation and protection, so the intimacy of Oneness with all things becomes a natural way of living for all.</p>

				<p>These classes can be attended separately if you have taken the prerequisite classes or to receive the most benefit, take them together as a four-day intensive to change your life forever!</p>
