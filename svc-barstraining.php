			<p>What previous participants have said of a Bars<sup>&reg</sup> training with Renee:</p>

			<blockquote>
				Renee provides a warm and inviting environment for learning the Bars for new and experienced practitioners.  She gently guides and assists each student during the class to help maximize their learning experience.  In addition, she easily incorporates the Access Consciousness tools so that all of the participants can experience the clearings and a new way of being.

			<blockquote>
				The 8 hour healing session that we called "the Access Bars training" was incredibly powerful.  In the morning, the first  round of Bars exchange was emotional, healing and unlike anything I have experienced in my life.  Every time someone in the room decided to release a limitation, I felt the energetic invitation to release this from my world as well.  This was freeing, expansive and magical!  Renee held the space so peacefully and offered up clarity, support, verbal processing and the ability to stay in the question so eloquently.  I am truly inspired by Access Consciousness and excited to offer my new tool of Bars to my family, friends and clients.
