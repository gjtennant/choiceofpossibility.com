			<h2>Beach Sessions</h2>

			<p>Not all healing needs to happen in a still position. Sometimes the act of movement can assist in releasing what's caught, and what better place to move than by the ocean?</p>

			<p>Come walk on the beach with me, and as we walk, we will do energetic work. Being out in Nature can be quite freeing, especially if you go barefoot!</p>

			<h4>How these sessions came up</h4>

			<p>I wanted to lose my belly fat. Walking on the beach barefoot was suggested, so in the process I started working on myself. Surprise, surprise, my body was holding that belly fat for quite a few emotional reasons. I could have walked and exercised every day, and I would probably have ultimately failed, or at least not maintained the gains I had to work so hard to achieve. It was not safe for my body to release that fat. It would have done everything it could to keep that safety-fat in place. Maybe you are in the same place. Come walk with me and let's find out.</p>

			<p>This is a great way to get the most out of your exercise.</p>

			<blockquote>
				"I started working with Renee in weekly beach walking sessions for the last three months. These weekly beach walks have been a life changing experience, helping me align my body and spirit. I reached out to Renee since what resonated the most in her website was her experience sharing that belly fat sometimes needs to be worked through and is a symptom of possibly other issues happening with the body and our emotions. I had gained weight and wanted to get to the root cause. Through our walks I found out that I carried my emotions in my physical body and couldn't process certain emotions, which was impacting my physical health. After less than 3 months, I have lost 27 lbs along with diet and regular exercise and I feel blessed to walk with Renee every week. She came highly recommended from a family friend that had worked with her as a family unit to resolve their internal family dynamics and challenges. The positive results are not only physical but emotional as well. I feel that through the beach walks I have gained an emotional balance and clarity that wasn't always easy for me to achieve."
